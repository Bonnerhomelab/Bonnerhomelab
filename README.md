[Brief Introduction]

My mission is to protect organizations from evolving cyber threats through ethical, 
resilient, and data-driven security practices that align with industry standards and 
regulatory compliance.

## Objective
Enhance Cybersecurity Operations: Leverage skills in threat detection, vulnerability assessments, and malware analysis to contribute to robust cybersecurity operations and incident response teams.

Advance Security Knowledge: Continuously develop expertise in network security, cloud protection, and risk management to support organizations in mitigating cyber risks and ensuring regulatory compliance.

Optimize Threat Mitigation: Use OSINT tools and SIEM platforms to efficiently identify and neutralize threats, while maintaining up-to-date knowledge on emerging cyber threats.

Support Vulnerability Management: Assist in conducting in-depth vulnerability assessments using tools like Nessus, Nmap, and Wireshark, and contribute to remediation efforts.

Strengthen Incident Response: Apply hands-on experience in incident investigation, email-based communication with registrars, and analysis of phishing threats to improve response times and security posture.

Develop Data-Driven Insights: Utilize data analysis and reporting skills to produce actionable cybersecurity reports, identifying trends and assisting in the development of proactive defense strategies.

Build on Technical Certifications: Build on certifications such as Certified in Cybersecurity (CC), CompTIA Security+, and Cisco Networking Academy to further advance skills and knowledge in cybersecurity and networking.

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
